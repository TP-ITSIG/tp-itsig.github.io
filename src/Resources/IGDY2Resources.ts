    description: "This subject provides you with the knowledge and skills to develop graphical interactive games through the use of existing game libraries and to create the component parts of a game, both assets and programming code, and then bring them together to produce a complete game. The subject covers game development techniques such as sprite creation, rendering and animation; collision detection; the main game loop; event handling and control of the frame rate. The in-game usage of sound effects will also be taught, as well as key programming concepts required in game development such as memory management, programming standards and debugging.",
